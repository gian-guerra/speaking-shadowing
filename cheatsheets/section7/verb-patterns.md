## üü£ 9. Verb Patterns

When one verb follows another, the second verb can take one of several forms:
- **to-infinitive**
- **infinitive without to**
- **-ing**

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Verb + to-Infinitive

Some verbs are directly followed by **to + verb**:

> **agree, aim, appear, arrange, attempt, be able, be likely, claim, decide, deserve, fail, hope, learn, manage, offer, plan, promise, refuse, seem, tend, try**

‚úîÔ∏è _I decided to do a course._  
‚úîÔ∏è _She hopes to work with animals._

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Verb + object + to-Infinitive

Some verbs require an **object** before the infinitive:

> **advise, allow, encourage, force, get, persuade, remind, teach, tell, warn**

‚úîÔ∏è _They advised me to apply early._  
‚úîÔ∏è _The course taught us to respect animals._

üí° **get** + object + to-infinitive = persuade:  
_He got his teacher to extend the deadline._

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Verb + to-Infinitive (with or without object)

These can be used with or without an object:

> **ask, choose, dare, expect, help, intend, need, prefer, prepare, want**

‚úîÔ∏è _I want to touch the animals._  
‚úîÔ∏è _They wanted us to touch the animals._

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Verb + -ing

Some verbs are always followed by **-ing**:

> **avoid, consider, deny, enjoy, finish, give up, imagine, include, keep, mention, mind, practise, recommend, resist, suggest, think of/about**

‚úîÔ∏è _I enjoy working with animals._  
‚úîÔ∏è _They suggested going earlier._

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Verb (+ preposition) + -ing

If a verb is followed by a **preposition**, then the next verb is **always in -ing** form:

> _I‚Äôm thinking **about doing** another course._  
> _We insisted **on seeing** the manager._

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Verb + object + infinitive **without** to

Certain verbs skip ‚Äúto‚Äù and go straight to the base verb:

> **feel, hear, help, let, make, notice, see, watch**

‚úîÔ∏è _They made us handle snakes._  
‚úîÔ∏è _She let him go early._  
‚úîÔ∏è _I heard her shout._

‚ö†Ô∏è **In passive**, use **to**:
- _We were made to handle animals._

üü™ **Help**:  
- Accepts both forms:  
  _She helped me understand._ / _She helped me to understand._

---

### ‚úÖ 7. Verb + to-infinitive OR -ing (similar meaning)

Some verbs accept both forms with little difference:

> **attempt, begin, bother, continue, hate, like, love, prefer, start**

‚úîÔ∏è _I like to feed the animals._ / _I like feeding the animals._
