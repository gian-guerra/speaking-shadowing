## 🟣 14. The Passive Voice

The **active voice** shows what the subject does.  
The **passive voice** shows what happens **to** the subject.

🟪 Passive form = **be** + **past participle**  
Optional: **by + agent (doer of the action)**

  (vs. _I advise you to return the form._ ✅ more direct)

- Describing a **process**  
  _The union **is run** by officers **elected by students**._

Two passive reporting structures are common:

#### 🔹 A. **it + passive verb + that**  
Used with verbs like:

✔️ _It **was felt** that the facilities needed improvement._

### ✅ 4. Have Something Done

Used to show that someone else does something **for you** (often paid/professional):

**Structure:** _have + object + past participle_

✔️ _You’ll need to **have your photo taken**._  
✔️ _I’m going to **have my hair cut**._

🔹 In informal English, **get + past participle** is also common:

### ✅ 5. Need + -ing

You can use **need + -ing** instead of the passive to say that something **requires** action (without saying who will do it):

✔️ _Some facilities **need improving**._  
✔️ _The room **needs cleaning**._

💡 Equivalent to: _Some facilities **need to be improved**._
