## 🟣 11. Likelihood Based on Conditions II (Third & Mixed Conditionals)

---

### ✅ 1. Third Conditional (Past Hypothetical)

**Structure:**  
`if + past perfect, would(n’t) have + past participle`  
→ _If you'd asked me, I'd have done it._

**Use:**  
- Imagines the opposite of something that already happened  
- Regrets or hypothetical past results

✔️ _If I’d bought a used car, I wouldn’t have taken a loan._

💡 Use **might/could** instead of would for less certainty:  
_If I’d saved more, I might have gone on that trip._

### ✅ 2. Mixed Conditionals

Mixed conditionals = if-clause and result refer to **different time frames**:

| Type                                      | Structure                                                  | Example                                           |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Past → Present**                        | if + past perfect, would + base verb                      | _If I’d saved more, I’d be rich now._             |
| **Past → Future**                         | if + past perfect, would + be + -ing                      | _If I hadn’t broken my wrist, I’d be playing now._|
| **Present → Past**                        | if + past simple, would have + past participle            | _If I were sensible, I’d have saved more._        |
| **Present → Future**                      | if + past simple, would be + -ing                         | _If I wasn’t busy, I’d be going to the concert._  |
| **Future → Present**                      | if + was/were + -ing, would be + base verb                | _If I wasn’t meeting my manager, I’d be there._   |
| **Present → Future**                      | if + past simple, would be + -ing                         | _If I was home, I’d be seeing her tomorrow._      |

### ✅ 3. Wishes & Regrets

**Wish + past simple** = present situation you want to change:  
✔️ _I wish I could help you._ (= but I can’t)  
✔️ _I wish my dad wasn’t always right._

**Wish + would + base verb** = express frustration about others:  
✔️ _I wish they would stop talking._  
❌ Don’t use this with stative verbs (e.g., be, have)

**Wish + past perfect** = past regrets:  
✔️ _I wish I’d thought about the costs._  
✔️ _I wish I’d never bought the car._

🟪 You can also use **if only** instead of "wish":  
_If only I had listened to my father._

---

### ✅ 4. Should(n’t) Have (Past Mistakes)

**Structure:**  
`should(n’t) have + past participle`

✔️ _I should have listened to him._  
✔️ _I should never have bought that._

Use **never** for emphasis in regrets:
✔️ _I should never have trusted them._

---

### 🟣 Grammar Extra – “If it wasn’t for…”

**If it wasn’t/weren’t for + noun**  
→ used to show a condition that supports a current result  
✔️ _If it weren’t for the car, I’d have no money problems._

**If it hadn’t been for + noun**  
→ refers to past situations  
✔️ _If it hadn’t been for your advice, I’d have failed._
