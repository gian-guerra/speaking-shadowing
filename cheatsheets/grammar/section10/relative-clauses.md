## 🟣 13. Relative Clauses

Relative clauses give more information about a **noun or noun phrase**. They are introduced by a **relative pronoun** (who, which, that, etc.), which connects the clause to the noun it describes.

✔️ _Why not install lights **which have a timer**?_  
❌ _Why not install lights which **they** have a timer?_

### ✅ 1. Relative Pronouns

| Pronoun | Used For      | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **who** | people         | _Mike Bowers, **who** is going to talk to us..._ |
| **which** | things        | _A flat **which** is in a high-rise building_ |
| **that** | people/things (only in defining clauses) | _Find someone **that** can check your home._ |
| **where** | places        | _The place **where** you keep your valuables_ |
| **when** | times          | _At times **when** you would normally be home_ |
| **whose** | possession    | _A person **whose** job involves travel_ |
| **why** | reason (after “reason”) | _There are reasons **why** one house is burgled..._ |

🟪 Notes:
- ❌ **"That" is not used in non-defining clauses**
- ✅ We can use **participle clauses** instead of relative clauses:  
  _The man **sitting** beside me = The man who is sitting..._  
  _The food **kept** in the fridge = The food which is kept..._

### ✅ 2. Defining Relative Clauses

Used to **clearly identify** the noun being described.

✔️ _Find someone **who** can collect your mail._  
✔️ _Store away any objects **that** could become missiles._

Without them, the sentence would be unclear:  
❌ _Store away any objects if it gets windy._ ← Which objects?

#### 🔹 Dropping the pronoun:
We can **omit** the relative pronoun when it's the **object**:  
✔️ _Maybe there’s a neighbour (**that**) you can ask._  
✔️ _This is the course (**which**) I chose._  

But not when it's the **subject**:  
❌ _The house is empty, (that) is a problem._

### ✅ 3. Non-defining Relative Clauses

These give **extra, non-essential information**. They are:
- Set off by **commas**
- Use **who, which, whose** (❌ not "that")
- Cannot omit the pronoun

✔️ _I applied to the university, **which** is in the city centre._  
✔️ _My house, **which** I redecorated, is larger now._  
✔️ _Mr. Smith, **who** was my teacher, got married._

Relative pronoun can refer to:
- A **noun**: _My neighbour, who lives upstairs..._  
- A **whole clause**:  
  _Some people just lock doors, **which** is fine unless there’s a storm._

### ✅ 4. Prepositions in Relative Clauses

#### 🔹 Informal (spoken) → preposition at the end:
✔️ _A neighbour **that you can rely on**_  
✔️ _A place **which I applied to**_

#### 🔹 Formal (written) → preposition before pronoun:
✔️ _...the universities **to which** I applied._  
✔️ _My boss, **for whom** I’ve worked for 30 years..._

✔️ _I’m at the **stage where** I’m ready to quit._
