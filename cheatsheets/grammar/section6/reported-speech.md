## 🟣 8. Reported Speech

We use reported speech to share what someone said — usually by shifting **tenses, pronouns**, and **time expressions**.

### ✅ 1. Tense Changes

When reporting, we usually move the verb **1 tense back**:

| Direct Speech Tense          | Reported Speech                     |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Present simple: _I live_     | Past simple: _She said she lived_   |
| Present continuous: _I’m living_ | Past continuous: _was living_     |
| Past simple: _I lived_       | Past perfect: _had lived_           |
| Past continuous: _was living_| Past perfect continuous: _had been living_ |
| Present perfect: _I’ve lived_| Past perfect: _had lived_           |
| Past perfect: _I’d lived_    | Past perfect: _had lived_ (no change) |
| be going to: _I’m going to_  | was/were going to                   |
| will: _I’ll live_            | would: _She said she would live_    |
| may/might: _I might live_    | might: _She said she might live_    |
| can: _I can live_            | could                               |
| must: _I must live_          | had to                              |

➡️ We often **don’t change the tense** if:
- The information is **still true**  
  _“This has nothing to do with the figures.” → He said it has nothing to do..._
- The original tense is **past simple or past continuous** and matches context  
  _“We decided...” → West claimed they decided..._

### ✅ 3. Time References

| Direct | Reported       |
|--------|----------------|
| today  | that day       |
| yesterday | the day before |
| now    | then / straight away |
| tomorrow | the next day / following day |
| this   | that           |
| here   | there          |

Also:  
- _“I like you.” → He said he liked her._  
- _“I love you.” → I said I loved her._

---

### ✅ 4. Reporting Questions

- Use **statement word order** (no inversion)  
  ✅ _He asked how she was feeling._  
  ❌ _He asked how was she feeling._

- For **WH- questions**, keep the word:  
  _“What caused this?” → She asked what caused it._

- For **yes/no questions**, use **if/whether**:  
  _“Did it work?” → He asked if it worked._

⚠️ Do **not** use a question mark in reported questions.

- _apparently, supposedly, seemingly_  

➡️ _According to the news, they are closing the store._  
➡️ _Apparently, they’re cutting 150 jobs._
