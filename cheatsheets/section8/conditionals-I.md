## 🟣 10. Likelihood Based on Conditions I (Conditionals)

Conditional sentences express a **condition (if-clause)** and a **result**.  
They can start with the "if"-clause or the result clause.

---

### ✅ 1. Zero Conditional

**Structure:**  
`if + present simple, present simple`  
→ _If you heat water, it boils._

**Use:**  
- General truths, facts, habits  
- If = "whenever" / "every time"  
  _If you own a car, you have to pay taxes._

💡 Use past tense for facts no longer true:  
_When I was a child, if I helped her, she gave me money._

### ✅ 2. First Conditional

**Structure:**  
`if + present simple, will/won’t + base verb`  
→ _If I invest, it will grow._

**Use:**  
- Real, possible future situations  
- Can also use:  
  - **might / may / could** for less certainty  
    _If I invest, I might lose money._  
  - **can** for general possibility  
    _If you travel at rush hour, trains can be full._  
  - **should / must** for advice  
    _If someone asks, we should help._

💡 You can use **modal verbs** in the result to show **intent, advice, or possibility**.

### ✅ 3. Second Conditional

**Structure:**  
`if + past simple, would/might/could + base verb`  
→ _If I invested, I would grow my savings._

**Use:**  
- Imaginary, unlikely or impossible situations  
- Refers to present or future  
  _If I went travelling, I wouldn’t have any money._

✔️ _If I had your portfolio, I would be working for a US company already._  
➡️ (present imaginary + **would be + -ing** = unreal ongoing action now)

🟪 **Be**: use either _was_ or _were_ (formal):  
- _If I were you, I’d do it._  
- _If she was here, we’d ask her._

✔️ _If you were to spend a year abroad, you’d need more money._
