Project Manager (Sarah): Alright, team — let’s talk about next week. First, what’s the plan for the payment module?

You: I’m meeting with the backend team on Monday. We’re going to review the latest API changes.

Sarah: Perfect. So you think you’ll be able to integrate it next sprint?

You: Yes, I will start the integration on Tuesday. If all goes well, we will have completed it by Friday.

Sarah: Nice. And what about the UI redesign?

You: Jess is presenting the final Figma mockups on Wednesday. After that, we’re going to begin implementation.

Sarah: Sounds good. Remember that the client calls us Thursday at 10 AM — they want a quick walkthrough.

You: Right, I’ll be ready for that. I will be preparing the demo right before the meeting.

Sarah: Great! What about the migration script?

You: I’m about to test it locally. If no errors come up, I will deploy it to staging tonight.

Sarah: Awesome. And by next Friday, we will have shipped all these updates to production?

You: That’s the goal! We just need to stick to the timeline.

Sarah: Alright team, let’s make it happen
