Alex: I {attempted to fix} the last-minute bugs, but I {failed to spot} a few critical issues.
Priya: Yeah, I noticed. Next time, we should {prepare to test} earlier instead of rushing.
Alex: I totally agree. Also, I {ought to remind} the team to submit their reports sooner.
Priya: Good idea. I {insist on checking} everyone's progress weekly from now on.
Alex: Maybe we should {arrange to meet} every Friday to stay on track.
Priya: Sure! I don't {mind staying} a bit longer to review things properly.
Alex: Honestly, I {can't stand dealing} with these last-minute emergencies.
Priya: Same here. Sometimes, I even {consider quitting} when it gets too chaotic.
Alex: No way! You {seem to handle} pressure way better than I do.
Priya: Thanks, but I just {carry on pretending} Iâ€™m calm most of the time.
Alex: Haha, well, at least we both {deserve to relax} a little after this mess!
Priya: Agreed! Maybe after the next release, we should {plan to take} a few days off.
