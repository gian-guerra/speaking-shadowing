Mia: Lately, I've {started considering} {applying} for a senior developer position. Do you {think it's worth trying}?
Daniel:Definitely. You {deserve to take} that step. Just {prepare to explain} your leadership experiences during the interview.
Mia: Right. I {intend to highlight} the projects where I led small teams. I also {plan to show} the apps we launched successfully.
Daniel: Good strategy. You might {want to avoid mentioning} any failed projects unless you {can explain learning} from them.
Mia: Got it. I'm a bit nervous though. I {can't help feeling} like I'm not ready sometimes.
Daniel: That's normal. But remember, you {managed to complete} complex projects already. Don't {forget to trust} yourself.
Mia:Thanks. Would you {mind reviewing} my portfolio later?
Daniel: Of course. I {enjoy helping} people grow. Plus, you {seem to have} strong potential.
Mia: Thanks again! I'll {carry on updating} my documents today and {promise to send} them to you tomorrow.
