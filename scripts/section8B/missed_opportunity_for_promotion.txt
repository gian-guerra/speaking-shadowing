Tessa: If I {had completed} that cloud certification last year, I {would be leading} this infrastructure project now.
Rahul: Yeah… If I {had applied} earlier for the mentorship program, I {would be working} with the architecture team by now.
Tessa: It’s frustrating, right? If we {had planned} our goals more intentionally, things {would look} different today.
Rahul: Totally. If I {hadn’t taken} so long to finish that last project, I {might be managing} the next client rollout.
Tessa: Ugh, same. If only I {had said} yes to that internal mobility offer, I {wouldn’t be stuck} maintaining legacy code again.
Rahul: Well… better late than never. If you {start} prepping now, you {can still apply} for the next round.
