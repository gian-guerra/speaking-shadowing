Leila: If I {were} more assertive, I {would have shared} my concerns during the sprint review.
Dan: I get it. If I {felt} more confident about my idea, I {would have jumped in} earlier too.
Leila: Honestly, I froze. If I {weren’t} so afraid of being wrong, I {might have challenged} that plan properly.
Dan: It’s hard. If you {had spoken} up though, they probably {would have listened} — you made some great points afterward.
Leila: Thanks. But I keep thinking… if I {were} more experienced, I {wouldn’t have hesitated} so much.
Dan: Don’t worry — that confidence {comes} with time. If I {had known} how supportive the PM would be, I {would have raised} the issue too.
