Sophia: Did you catch what Liam {reported} during the stand-up {this morning}?
Ethan: Not everything. What exactly {did} he {say}?
Sophia: He {stated that} the server {had crashed} {the night before} due to a memory leak. He {explained that} they {had already patched} the issue temporarily.
Ethan: {Did} he {say} how it happened?
Sophia: Yeah, he {claimed that} a third-party library {had caused} unexpected behavior under high load. He {warned that} we {should monitor} the logs closely {today}.
Ethan: That's serious. {Did} he {ask} for any specific actions from us?
Sophia: He {asked if} we {could} help review the code changes {straight away}. He also {wanted to know whether} anyone {had noticed} similar issues in other services.
Ethan: And {had} we?
Sophia: I {informed him that} our microservices {had been stable} so far. But I {agreed that} it {was} a good idea to double-check everything {this afternoon}.
Ethan: {Did} he {mention} anything about client impact?
Sophia: He {assured us that} no customer {had been affected} because the backup servers {had kicked in} immediately.
Ethan: Thatâ€™s a relief. {According to} the operations team, they're planning to run extra load tests {the following week}.
Sophia: Yeah, and {apparently} the CTO {suggested} adding more redundancy to our architecture {soon}.
