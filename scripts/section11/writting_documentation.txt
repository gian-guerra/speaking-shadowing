Julia: Hey, just checking in — has the API documentation {been finalized}?
Mark: Almost. The structure {was approved} last week, and the diagrams {are being reviewed} now by the client.
Julia: Great. And the PDF version — has that {been shared} with them yet?
Mark: Not yet. It’ll {be exported} and {sent} once the final comments {are incorporated}.
Julia: Makes sense. I heard the security audit report {was requested} by their legal team. Has that {been handled}?
Mark: Yes, it {was delivered} yesterday. The encryption protocols {were outlined} clearly, and no objections {have been raised} so far.
Julia: That’s a relief. Also, can you make sure the glossary {is included} in the final doc package?
Mark: Absolutely. It’s already {been prepared} and {will be appended} to the end of the main file.
Julia: Perfect. Once the doc {is submitted}, I’ll follow up with them to confirm everything {was received} properly.
Mark: Got it. Everything should {be wrapped up} by EOD.
