Daniel: We {must} finish the slides by tonight. The meeting’s first thing tomorrow morning.
Emma: Yeah, you're right. We {should} also double-check the data. Last time, a typo {could have} cost us the project.
Daniel: Good point. Maybe we {ought to} run a practice session too, just to be sure everything flows well.
Emma: Agreed. Also, the boss said we {have to} include the new market analysis. I {might} stay a bit late to work on it if needed.
Daniel: Thanks, Emma. I {could} help you if you want. Two heads are better than one.
Emma: That would be great! Plus, we {shouldn't} forget to update the client list. I almost left it out last time.
Daniel: Haha, no worries. Oh, by the way — we {don't have to} bring printed copies, right? I heard it's all digital now.
Emma: Yeah, that's true. But we {might want to} bring a few, just in case the projector fails or something.
Daniel: Good thinking. Better safe than sorry.
