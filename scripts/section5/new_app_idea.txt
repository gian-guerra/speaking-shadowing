Liam: Hey, do you think we {could} create a mobile app that recommends coding tutorials based on someone's skill level?
Sophia: Yeah, that {could} work! We {might} need a solid algorithm, though. Have you heard of any tools we {can} use to build recommendation systems easily?
Liam: Actually, TensorFlow {can be} an option. Or, if that's too complex, we {are able to} use some simpler APIs like RapidAPI.
Sophia: Good point. Also, we {may} want to think about scalability. If a lot of users join, we {might have to} upgrade our server pretty quickly.
Liam: True. And in case TensorFlow feels like overkill, we {could always} switch to basic filtering methods at first.
Sophia: Exactly! It's good to remember that there {are alternatives to} heavy machine learning solutions.
Sometimes a smart SQL query {is able to} do the trick!
Liam: Haha, so true! And who knows â€” we {might even} get some investors if the app takes off.
Sophia: I like your optimism. Let's {see if we can} draft a basic plan tonight.
