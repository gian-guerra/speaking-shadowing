Laura: Hey, we {should} start early on Saturday if we want to reach the summit before noon.
Ben: Yeah, especially because the weather {might} change later in the day. We {must} pack enough water and snacks too.
Laura: Definitely. Also, we {ought to} check the trail conditions online. Some paths {could} still be closed after last week's storm.
Ben: Good idea. Oh, and remember, we {have to} get a hiking permit from the park office. They {won't} let us in without it.
Laura: Right, I almost forgot! Do you think we {should} bring an extra jacket? It {might} get cold up there.
Ben: Better to be prepared. You {don't have to} bring heavy gear, but a windbreaker {would} be smart.
Laura: Got it. Also, we {might want to} bring a flashlight. Just in case something delays us.
Ben: True. Even though we {plan to} be back before dark, anything {could} happen. We {shouldn't} underestimate the trail.
Laura: Agreed! I'm excited â€” this {will} be an awesome adventure if we plan it right!
