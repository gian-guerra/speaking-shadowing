Lucas: Hey, do you think we {can} hike up to Crystal Peak this Saturday?
Sophia: Maybe! But we {should} check the weather forecast first. It {might} rain all weekend.
Lucas: True. If it pours, we {could} always pick an easier trail. Also, do you think Jake {will be able to} join us? He’s been super busy lately.
Sophia: I asked him yesterday, and he said he {might} come if he finishes his project by Friday. Otherwise, he {may} have to work overtime.
Lucas: Got it. We {could} also invite Mia and Tom. They're usually up for spontaneous trips.
Sophia: Good idea! Even if Jake {can't} make it, we {won't} have to cancel everything. Plus, Tom {can} drive if we {need} an extra car.
Lucas: Awesome. We {could} bring some snacks too — you {know}, just in case we {get} stuck somewhere and {can't} find food.
Sophia: Haha, classic you. Always thinking ahead. Alright, let’s {make sure we can} finalize the plan by Thursday!
