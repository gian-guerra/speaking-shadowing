Jasmine: I’ve been reading the reviews, and most users are really excited {about} the new scheduling interface.
Leo: Yeah, but I also noticed a few people {complained about} performance issues {in} older devices.
Jasmine: True. We might need to {talk to} the mobile devs and see if there’s a workaround. Also, some feedback {referred to} the UI being a bit too cluttered.
Leo: I {spoke to} Diego from UX earlier — he’s already thinking {about} simplifying the layout for smaller screens.
Jasmine: That’s great. And did anyone {apologize for} the delay in the release notes? Some customers {wrote to} us {about} that.
Leo: Yeah, Carlos {explained to} them that we were waiting for QA clearance. But we probably need a better process {for} communicating changes.
Jasmine: Definitely. And I’m {concerned about} our Slack channel being too quiet. I {relied on} it a lot for instant team feedback.
Leo: Same here. I think people are {focused on} wrapping up their sprints. Maybe we should {remind} them {about} posting updates.
Jasmine: Good idea. Also, let’s not {forget about} the accessibility audit. I’m {anxious about} the results coming {in} next week.
Leo: Fingers crossed. We {prepared for} that with all those alt text and contrast fixes, so hopefully it goes well.
Jasmine: Here’s hoping. Thanks {for} jumping in today — I really {appreciate} your help.
