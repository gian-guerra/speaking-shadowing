Professor Martin: So, how’s the group project coming along?
Student Ava: Honestly, I’m a bit {worried about} the presentation part. One team member keeps {arguing with} others {about} the design choices.
Professor Martin: Group dynamics can be tricky. Have you tried {talking to} him directly?
Ava: Yes, I {spoke to} him yesterday and tried to {explain} the rationale {for} our choices, but he didn’t seem convinced.
Professor Martin: Sometimes people just need time. Have you {discussed} the roles and responsibilities clearly?
Ava: We did. We even {divided} the tasks {among} ourselves fairly, but he keeps {complaining about} having to do the visuals.
Professor Martin: Maybe he’s just not confident {in} that area. You could {suggest} switching his task {with} someone who’s more experienced.
Ava: That could work. Also, I {wrote to} the group chat {about} scheduling another meeting, but no one’s replied yet.
Professor Martin: Try {reminding} them politely. Sometimes people need a little push, especially when they’re {under} pressure.
Ava: Yeah, you’re right. I guess I was just {upset with} the lack of communication.
Professor Martin: Totally understandable. Just keep {focused on} what you can control, and try to {deal with} conflicts constructively.
Ava: Thanks. I really {appreciate} your advice. It helps to {talk to} someone who understands group dynamics.
Professor Martin: You’re doing great. Remember, learning to collaborate is just as important as the final product.
