Sarah: Hey Leo, did you get my note {about} the crashing issue?
Leo: Yeah, I did. I’ve been {working on} reproducing it since this morning. Turns out it only happens when the user logs in {with} a social account.
Sarah: Ugh, classic. I’m kind of {annoyed with} how unstable the auth library is lately.
Leo: Same here. I even {wrote to} their support team {about} it, but no reply yet. I {apologize for} not keeping you updated earlier — was knee-deep in logs.
Sarah: No worries! I {rely on} you for these tricky bugs — you always spot something I miss.
Leo: Haha, well… I’m {anxious about} pushing a hotfix without QA’s green light. They still haven’t {responded to} my ticket.
Sarah: Want me to {talk to} someone from their team? I’m {friendly with} Matt from QA — maybe he can help.
Leo: That would be awesome, thanks! Also, while you’re at it, can you {ask about} the flaky tests in the staging suite?
Sarah: On it. And hey, thanks again — this issue’s been eating {at} me all week.
