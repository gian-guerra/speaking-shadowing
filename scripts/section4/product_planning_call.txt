Sofia (Product Manager): We’ve finally defined {the scope of the new feature}, and it aligns with {the needs of our clients}.
Tomás (Developer): That’s great! I already started designing {a solution with minimal infrastructure changes}. I think that’ll help speed up development.
Sofia: I like that. We also reviewed {the plan to reduce user drop-off during onboarding}, and the team agreed it's a top priority.
Tomás: Yeah, I saw that in {the document shared by the UX team}. They had {some ideas based on the recent feedback}.
Sofia: Exactly. Plus, we got {a list of action items} from {the meeting with the investors}. They want to see faster results.
Tomás: What about {the backend module updated last month}? Is it stable?
Sofia: Yes, that’s {a module tested with high concurrency scenarios}. No major issues reported.
Tomás: Awesome. That’ll give us {a good base to implement the changes}. Just send me {the final version of the requirements}, and I’ll get started.
Sofia:  Will do! Let’s also meet next week to discuss {the best time to launch the beta version}.
