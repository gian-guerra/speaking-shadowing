Sarah: If we {had} a dedicated UX designer on the team, our interfaces {would look} way more polished.
Leo: I agree. If the stakeholders {gave} us more flexibility, we {could experiment} with better design patterns.
Sarah: Yeah, and if we {weren’t rushing} every release, we {would catch} more usability issues.
Leo: Exactly. If the roadmap {allowed} more breathing room, our features {might be} more refined.
Sarah: Also, if marketing {communicated} changes earlier, we {wouldn’t have} to redo designs last minute.
Leo: Ugh, yes. If I {were} in charge of timelines, I {would add} a review buffer after every sprint.
Sarah: That would help a lot. If QA {had} more visibility earlier, we {could prevent} those late surprises.
Leo: And honestly, if we {trusted} each team’s expertise more, the whole process {would run} smoother.
