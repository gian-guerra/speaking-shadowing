Lucas: If I {wake} up early and avoid distractions, I {usually finish} my deep work by noon.
Tania: Lucky you. If I {had} a quieter apartment, I {would get} way more done in the mornings.
Lucas: Totally. You {might feel} more focused {if you {tried}} working from a co-working space once or twice a week.
Tania: Maybe! I’d go {provided that} it {has} good internet and decent coffee.
Lucas: Haha, fair. As long as you {set} boundaries with Slack and emails, your afternoons {will be} more productive.
Tania: Yeah, I need to work on that. If I {weren’t} constantly switching tasks, my code quality {would improve} a lot.
Lucas: Also, {unless} I {schedule} breaks deliberately, I just burn out halfway through the day.
Tania: Same. That’s why I plan my day in case something urgent {comes} up unexpectedly.
Lucas: Smart move. Even if things {go} off track, having structure {helps} you reset faster.
