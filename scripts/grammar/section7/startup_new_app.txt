Zoe: We {planned to release} the beta version last week, but a few unexpected bugs came up.
Liam: Yeah, I {remember fixing} that authentication issue, but then the payment gateway started failing.
Zoe: Exactly. At this point, we {can't stand delaying} the launch any longer. We {have to move} forward.
Liam: Agreed. I {offered to stay} late tonight to finish the last few tasks.
Zoe: Thanks! That {might help} us hit our new deadline. I {insist on testing} everything manually before we push it live.
Liam: Good idea. Also, the marketing team {suggested preparing} a last-minute demo video. They {want us to highlight} the new features.
Zoe: We {need to organize} that fast. Maybe we {could ask} Nathan to help with editing?
Liam: Yeah, Nathan {agreed to help} last time, so he {might not mind doing} it again.
Zoe: I'll {try calling} him after this meeting.
Liam: Perfect. By the way, I {prefer handling} backend tasks, but if needed, I {don't mind fixing} some frontend bugs too.
Zoe: Thanks, Liam. We all {must keep supporting} each other until launch day!
Liam: Definitely. Launching a product always {involves making} sacrifices, but itâ€™s so worth it in the end.
