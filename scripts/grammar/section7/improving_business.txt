Mia: I've been {trying to build} a better portfolio website, but it's taking forever.
Daniel: Maybe you should {consider hiring} a designer to help with the layout.
Mia: I {hate depending} on other people, but you might be right. I {aim to finish} the site by next month.
Daniel: That’s a good goal. Just {remember to update} your GitHub links and case studies too.
Mia: Thanks for the reminder! Sometimes I {forget to double-check} the smaller details.
Daniel: It's normal. When you’re busy, you might {go on overlooking} simple things. You just have to {keep improving} little by little.
Mia: Lately, I've {felt like giving up} a few times, though.
Daniel: Everyone goes through that. You must {refuse to quit} if you really want to succeed.
Mia: You’re right. I {hope to launch} my site before my next client meeting.
Daniel: Good plan. By the way, you should {ask your friends to review} your site before making it public.
Mia: Will do! And if they {suggest changing} anything, I’ll seriously think about it.
Daniel: Perfect. You’re {managing to grow} your freelance career faster than you realize.
