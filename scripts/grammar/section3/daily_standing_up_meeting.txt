Lena (Project Manager): Morning, team! Let’s keep this {brief} and {productive} today. Tim, how’s the backend migration going?
Tim (Backend Developer): Hey! It’s going {pretty smoothly}. I’ve moved the {most critical} endpoints already. The new structure is {far more efficient} than the previous one.
Lena: Nice. Is it {stable enough} for us to start QA testing?
Tim: Yes, but I’d recommend waiting {a little longer}. I’ll finish the database sync today — it’s taking {slightly more time} than expected.
Lena: No worries. Maya, how’s the frontend integration?
Maya (Frontend Developer): It’s coming together. The new design is {cleaner}, and the layout feels {more intuitive}. I added some transitions to make it {visually smoother}.
Lena: Awesome. Does it work well on mobile?
Maya: Yes! Actually, it runs {even better} on phones than before. I simplified the components and used {lighter assets}.
Lena: That’s {great to hear}. Out of curiosity, whose module loaded {fastest} during your last test?
Maya: Surprisingly, Tim’s API was the {quickest}, even with partial data. Mine came in {second fastest}.
Tim: Whoa! That’s a {first}, haha.
Lena: Haha, well done! Let’s aim to wrap up testing by the {end of the week}, so we can start polishing. Sound good?
Both: Sounds good!
