Nina: Did you see the feedback from QA? Several onboarding screens {werenâ€™t being rendered} properly on older Android versions.
Dev: Yeah, the layout XML {was corrupted} during the last merge. It {must have been overwritten} by an older branch.
Nina: Has the issue {been fixed}?
Dev: The fix {has already been pushed}, and a patch release {is being prepared} for tonight.
Nina: Good. Also, the animation on the welcome screen {was removed}, right?
Dev: Correct. It {was considered} too distracting, especially for accessibility compliance.
Nina: Have the UI assets {been optimized}?
Dev: Yes, we {had them compressed} by the design team. All images {were exported} using new performance settings.
Nina: Perfect. And what about translation issues?
Dev: All string files {have been reviewed}, and we {got the Korean version proofread} by a native speaker before shipping.
Nina: Excellent. Just make sure a changelog {is generated} for the patch. Legal requires it before sign-off.
