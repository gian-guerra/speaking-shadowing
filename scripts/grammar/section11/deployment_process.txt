Carlos: So, the new feature set {was rolled out} last night, right?
Maya: Yes, everything {was deployed} to production just after midnight. The migration script {had been tested} thoroughly, so there weren’t any surprises.
Carlos: Good. I noticed a couple of config files {were modified} — do you know if that {was logged}?
Maya: Absolutely. All changes {were tracked} in Git and {have been documented} in the deployment notes.
Carlos: Awesome. I also heard the cache {was invalidated} globally to avoid stale data?
Maya: Correct. That {was triggered} right after the database updates {had been completed}.
Carlos: Nice. Any issues reported?
Maya: One. A few user sessions {were affected} temporarily because of a token mismatch, but it {was resolved} within minutes.
Carlos: Alright. Let’s make sure that scenario {is included} in the incident review. It’s better if it {gets analyzed} for future prevention.
Maya: Already noted. A follow-up ticket {has been created}, and the engineering manager {was notified} this morning.
Carlos: Perfect. Another clean deployment — well done!
