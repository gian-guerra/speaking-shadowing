Sofia: Did you hear? The new checkout flow {has been criticized} by quite a few users.
Jake: Yeah, I saw the reviews. Apparently, the design {was copied} from another site and {wasn't adapted} well for mobile.
Sofia: That's true. It {was meant} to streamline the process, but a lot of edge cases {weren’t considered}.
Jake: Also, the button labels {are said to be} confusing. We {should have consulted} the copy team earlier.
Sofia: Definitely. A content audit {is being scheduled} this week. I already {had a report drafted} by the intern.
Jake: Nice. I think all touchpoints {must be reviewed} before the next update.
Sofia: The feedback form {was redesigned} last sprint, so maybe we’ll {get more detailed responses} this time.
Jake: Hopefully. Do you think the mobile version {will be prioritized} in the next sprint?
Sofia: Yes — it {has been requested} by multiple stakeholders already.
