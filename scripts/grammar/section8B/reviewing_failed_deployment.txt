Ethan: If we {had caught} that memory leak earlier, the app {wouldn’t have crashed} during the launch.
Carla: Exactly. And if QA {had run} a proper load test, we {might have spotted} it before Friday.
Ethan: Yeah… I {should have double-checked} the metrics dashboard after the last commit.
Carla: Honestly, we all missed it. But if we {had communicated} better with DevOps, they {could have helped} us flag it sooner.
Ethan: True. If I {hadn’t skipped} the daily stand-up, I {would have known} we were merging early.
Carla: And I {could have reminded} you too — that’s on me. If only we {had slowed down} a bit, the release {would have gone} smoothly.
Ethan: We learned the hard way. But at least we {created} an incident doc now — that {should have happened} a long time ago.
