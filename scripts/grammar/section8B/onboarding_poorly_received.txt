Clara: We {should have simplified} the onboarding flow. Users clearly got stuck on the first screen.
Ben: Yeah… We {might have confused} them by adding too many form fields upfront.
Clara: And I {could have removed} the optional steps entirely. They weren’t really necessary.

Clara: Definitely. Product {must have assumed} it was fine without checking with us.
Ben: Still, we {could have flagged} the complexity earlier during sprint planning.
Clara: Yeah… and I {should have trusted} my instinct when I felt something was off with the UX.
