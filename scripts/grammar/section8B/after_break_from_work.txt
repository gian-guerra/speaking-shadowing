Emily: I wish I {had taken} time off sooner. I didn’t realize how burned out I was.
Raj: Yeah, you {should have said} something. We all noticed, but we didn’t want to push you.
Emily: Thanks… But if I {had spoken} up earlier, I {might not have reached} that breaking point.
Raj: True. And if your team {had supported} you more proactively, things {would have looked} different now.
Emily: Yeah. But honestly, if I {weren’t} always trying to prove myself, I {would have asked} for help months ago.
Raj: That hits home. I wish I {didn’t feel} the same pressure sometimes.
Emily: You too?
Raj: Yeah. If I {hadn’t taken} on so many responsibilities, I {might have maintained} a better balance.
Emily: It’s hard. But if we {keep ignoring} our limits, burnout {will just keep coming} back.
