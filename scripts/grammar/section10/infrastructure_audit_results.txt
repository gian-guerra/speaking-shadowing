Maya: I reviewed the deployment pipeline logs, and there’s a step {which} regularly fails when load is high.
Dylan: Is it the script {that} provisions new containers?
Maya: Yes. The script {which} handles scaling relies on a legacy image {that} hasn’t been updated in months.
Dylan: That explains a lot. The Dockerfile {that} defines that image is the one {which} I meant to deprecate last quarter.
Maya: Well, now’s the time. There’s a security issue {which} affects the base OS used in that image.
Dylan: I’ll coordinate with the security team, {who} already flagged it in last week's report.
Maya: Good. The engineer {whose} job it is to maintain the CI/CD tooling is out this week, though.
Dylan: No worries — we’ll prepare a patch {that} he can review once he's back.
Maya: Also, we should document the behavior {that} led to the silent failure. It wasn’t obvious.
Dylan: Totally. Let's include a case study in the audit doc {which} explains the entire incident flow.
Maya: Great idea. It'll help any new team members {who} join during the next rotation.
