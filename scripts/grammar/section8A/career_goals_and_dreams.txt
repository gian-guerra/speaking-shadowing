Mia: If I {spoke} better English, I {would apply} for that remote role in Canada.
Josh: You totally could! If I {had} your portfolio, I {would be working} for a US company already.
Mia: Thanks. Honestly, if I {practiced} more speaking daily, I {might feel} more confident.
Josh: If you {wanted}, we {could set up} weekly speaking sessions together. I’m working on my fluency too.
Mia: That would be great. If I {didn’t worry} so much about sounding perfect, I {would enjoy} conversations more.
Josh: Totally relatable. If we just {focused} on expressing ideas, fluency {would come} with time.
Mia: Also, if I {took} some time to organize my GitHub properly, I {could attract} better opportunities.
Josh: Yup, and if you {added} more real-world projects, recruiters {would notice} fast.
Mia: You’re right. If I {got} serious about it this month, it {could open} doors next quarter.
