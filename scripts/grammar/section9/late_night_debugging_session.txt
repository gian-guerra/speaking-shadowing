Nina: I’ve been staring {at} this code for hours and still can’t figure out what’s wrong {with} the caching layer.
Eric: Let me take a look. You know, this reminds me {of} the issue we had last quarter — {with} the stale object references?
Nina: Oh right! I had almost {forgotten about} that. We {dealt with} it by refactoring some of the shared context logic.
Eric: Exactly. Also, I {talked to} DevOps earlier — they {mentioned} some suspicious latency spikes {in} the Redis instance.
Nina: Wait, that might be it! Could you {present this} to the team tomorrow morning? I don’t think everyone’s {aware of} it.
Eric: Sure. I’m also planning to {write to} the vendor to check if we need an upgrade. We’re already {at} 75% capacity.
Nina: Yeah, I’ve been {concerned about} that for weeks. It’s one of those bottlenecks that could become a big problem if we don’t act soon.
Eric: I {agree with} you completely. Let’s {rely on} some monitoring tonight and see what else pops up.
Nina: Alright. I’ll {keep working on} this fallback mechanism while you do that. Just {call me} if anything weird shows up.
Eric: Will do. This is one of those bugs that really gets you {in} deep, huh?
Nina: Definitely. But hey, that’s what makes it fun — sometimes.
