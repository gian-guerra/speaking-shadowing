Dear younger me,
I wish I had written more. Journals, letters, even messy drafts. I used to be afraid of writing things the wrong way — afraid I’d {make mistakes}, or forget a {capital letter}, or use the wrong {quotation marks}.
But looking back, I now know that those errors were part of learning. Every draft I had to {revise}, every paragraph I had to {go through} again — they taught me more than any rule ever could.
You don’t need to {omit} parts of yourself to sound perfect. Don't {leave out} your thoughts just because they feel awkward. Express them fully, honestly.
Also, try to {separate} the voice of doubt from the voice of progress. One tells you you’re not good enough. The other reminds you how far you’ve come.
It’s {encouraging} to realize that growth doesn’t come from avoiding mistakes — it comes from being {aware} of them and choosing to keep going.
So write. Make a mess. Say things you’re not sure about. One day, your words might become someone else’s truth — just like this letter became mine.
