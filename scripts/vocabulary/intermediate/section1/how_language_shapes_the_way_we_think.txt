Language is more than a tool for communication — it’s the lens through which we see the world. The words we {choose} don’t just express thoughts — they shape them.
Some languages {emphasize} respect, with formal verbs and honorifics. Others {stress} directness and clarity. Even the way we describe time or color can reflect cultural habits.
If we’re not {aware} of this, we risk misunderstanding others — or even ourselves. For example, English includes thousands of expressions, including {idioms} like “bite the bullet” or “jump the gun.” Their meanings can’t be guessed from the words alone.
Then there’s {slang}, which constantly evolves and carries deep social signals. In a formal setting, using the wrong slang can feel completely out of place.
When studying a new language, it helps to look at more than just grammar. Read the dictionary not only for the definition, but also for each {entry}’s real-life use. Ask: Is this word {relevant} to how I speak, or is it too {specialized} for everyday conversations?
And {instead of} learning ten words you’ll never use, focus on five that you’ll say every week. Words are power — but only when they match your world.
