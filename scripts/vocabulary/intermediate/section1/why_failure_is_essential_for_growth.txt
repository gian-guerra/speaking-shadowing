Many people fear failure. They see it as something to be avoided at all costs. But if we’re honest, failure teaches us more than success ever could.
{After a while}, you begin to see patterns. You learn to {make a note of} what went wrong and {revise} your approach. You notice the small things you used to {omit}, or the {mistakes} you made without realizing.
What’s {encouraging} is that growth doesn't require perfection. It only requires that you stay {aware} of how you're changing.
So {instead of} hiding from failure, we should embrace it — as long as we reflect, learn, and move forward.
I've failed in {a wide range} of ways — professionally, personally, emotionally. But each time, I come back stronger.
Success comes when we study ourselves, {such as} our habits, our words, and our mindset, with the same attention we give to books.
