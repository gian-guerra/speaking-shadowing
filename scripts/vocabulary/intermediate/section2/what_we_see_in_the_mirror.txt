We often judge people — and ourselves — by what we see in the mirror. But appearance isn’t just about looking “good” or “bad.” It tells a story.
Some people are naturally {well built}, with {broad shoulders} and a strong presence. Others are more {slim} or even {skinny} — not in an attractive way, but it’s just the way their body is. There’s no one standard.
Some women are {plump}, or even a bit {fattish}, but still carry themselves with elegance and confidence. A roundish face, a {neat} style, a graceful {figure} — all of it contributes to how they express themselves.
Skin plays a role too. After a vacation, someone might come back with a healthy, {tanned} glow. Others may have {smooth} skin, or a bit of {stubble}. A {clean-shaven} face can look sharp, while a bit of {receding} hair or being completely {bald} might add a mature charm.
We also describe people in moments. A woman might be {pregnant} — or as we sometimes say, {expecting a baby}. A teenager might be {pretty}, with {eyebrows} that express her personality more than words.
And looks change. Someone might be {in good shape} in their twenties and {in bad shape} by their forties — or the reverse.
Personally, I’ve learned that how we describe others often reveals more about us. Using words like {neat}, {slim}, or even {fattish} — or adding “-ish” to say someone is {youngish} or {tallish} — it shows our attempt to be precise… or polite.
The truth is: appearance is not the full picture. It’s just a first page in the story of someone’s life. What matters most is how we treat that story — with kindness, curiosity, and respect.
