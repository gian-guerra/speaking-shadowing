# Shadowing practice app with custom sentences

This application is designed just for improve pronounciation skills by using custome conversations in base of a clear and structured path in base of grammar, instead of just repeat a random sentence, with this you can create as many sentences you want for each grammar topic to fully understand the topic and have plenty of pronounciation practice for each one. 

## Schwa sound (/ʌ, ə/)

Are the same just ʌ is the stressed version of ə, the same mouth position
ʌ -> stressed long duration
ə -> unestressed short duration


## T Variations:

 - True /t/: Standard [t] sound, aspirated at the beginning of a word.
 (top, attack)
 - Aspirated /t/ [tʰ]: At the beginning of a stressed syllable. You can feel a puff of air. (top, take)
 - Unaspirated /t/	[t]: After /s/, no puff of air (compare top vs stop). (stop, star)
 - Flap T (Tap)	[ɾ]: Sounds like a fast /d/ in American English. Happens between vowels. (butter, water)
 - Glottal T [ʔ]: Common in some American and many British dialects. (button, mountain)
 - Held T (No release) [t̚]: Often at the end of a word when the /t/ is "held in" but not released. (cat, sit down)


## R variations:
 - /ɹ/ – The consonant "r": Used at the beginning of words or syllables
 -> red /ɹɛd/, run /ɹʌn/, right /ɹaɪt/

 - R-colored vowels (Rhotic vowels): These are vowels + r that form a single sound. In American English, the /ɹ/ often "colors" the vowel.

 1. /ɝ/ – Stressed "er" sound
 - Example words: bird, her, learn, nurse
 - /bɝd/, /hɝ/, /lɝn/, /nɝs/

 2. /ɚ/ – Unstressed "er" sound
 - Example words: better, teacher, mother
 - /ˈbɛtɚ/, /ˈtitʃɚ/, /ˈmʌðɚ/

 3. Vowel + /ɹ/ combinations (not merged into a single IPA vowel): These are combinations of vowels with /ɹ/, often transcribed as diphthongs or vowel-glide combinations:

 - /ɑr/ – as in car, star (/kɑɹ/, /stɑɹ/)

 - /ɔr/ – as in four, more (/fɔɹ/, /mɔɹ/)

 - /ɪr/ – as in beer, weird (/bɪɹ/, /wɪɹd/)

 - /ɛr/ – as in care, bear (/kɛɹ/, /bɛɹ/)

 - /aɪr/ – as in fire, tire (/faɪɹ/, /taɪɹ/)

 - /ʊr/ – as in tour, sure (/tʊɹ/, /ʃʊɹ/)
